## Enable Windows 10 automatic enrollment

Automatic enrollment lets users enroll their Windows 10 devices in Intune. To enroll, users add their work account to their personally owned devices or join corporate-owned devices to Azure Active Directory. In the background, the device registers and joins Azure Active Directory. Once registered, the device is managed with Intune.

**Prerequisites**
- Azure Active Directory Premium subscription ([trial subscription](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=816845))
- Microsoft Intune subscription

5. Use the default values for the following URLs:
    - **MDM Terms of use URL**
    - **MDM Discovery URL**
    - **MDM Compliance URL**

6. Select **Save**.

By default, two-factor authentication is not enabled for the service. However, two-factor authentication is recommended when registering a device. To enable two-factor authentication, configure a two-factor authentication provider in Azure AD and configure your user accounts for multi-factor authentication. See [Getting started with the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-cloud).
